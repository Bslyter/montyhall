Monty Hall Probability Game
The Monty Hall game (probability problem) follows a game show format 
where the player is given the option to select ONE of THREE doors. 
Similar to other hidden doors (hidden prizes) games, the player does 
not know what is behind each door. Two doors have goats behind them. 
One door has a new car behind it. The player gets the option of 
choosing a door, but the prize is not yet revealed. The host then 
opens one of the two doorsâ€”always revealing a goat. Lastly, the player 
has one final choice, stay with their first choice or choose the last 
remaining door. The prize is then revealed.

The function returns a length 3 character vector 
indicating the positions of goats and the car.
